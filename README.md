=====================

Password Strength Checker - JQuery  JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/cmikeseiler/csec6eox/

This is primarily a Password Strength Checker to comply with Active Directory requirements, namely three of the four of Symbol, UpperCase, LowerCase, and Number.  The default is set to a length of 8 charachters, but you can change that to your requirements.

The code displays a message to indicate what needs to happen.
